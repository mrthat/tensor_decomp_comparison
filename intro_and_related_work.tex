\chapter{Introduction}

There are many applications where we need to analyze face.
In computer graphics we want to synthesize face images, 
to edit existing images (say, change person's expression in a photo).
In human-computer interaction we want virtual avatars to copy the mimic
of real face. It may be convenient to be able to log into one's account
by just allowing the computer to scan one's face.
Some of these applications are naturally 3-dimensional (image synthesis
is rendering a 2D image of a 3D model),
some of them may become 3-dimensional in a short period of time (
since 3D technologies become more and more accessible,
it might be that a 3D-scanner will be a part of standard laptop
in the future, as a web-camera is now). 


The mainstream(?) approach to solve these problems 
is a statistical one: we acquire a large database of faces
and learn a statistical model with it.
Statistical models can be discriminative or generative,
we are interested in generative models.

%In this thesis we study the influence of numerical methods


\chapter{Related Work}


Blanz and Vetter introduced their famous model in ~\cite{bl_vet_2003}.
They arranged all the data in a matrix and proposed using principal
component analysis to learn the low-dimensional subspace.

In order to decouple identity and expression, 
Vasilescu and Terzopoulos in~\cite{vt_2002} considered a 3-dimensional
array (\textit{tensor}) and applied the same technique
to tensors (the idea originated in text analysis,
where the same technique was used to decouple author 
and style).
