\section{Higher-order SVD}
This method is analogous to standard method of computing PCA for matrices.
Recall that if $A$ is an $m \times n$ real matrix, then it can be decomposed as 
\begin{equation}
 A = U \Sigma V^T,
\end{equation}
where $\Sigma$ is a (rectangular) diagonal matrix with non-negative elements on the diagonal and $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal matrices: $U \in O(m)$, 
$V \in O(n)$. $U$ is called the matrix of left singular vectors (its columns are eigenvectors of $AA^T$), $V$ is the
matrix of right singulare vectors (eigenvectors of $A^TA$). Let $ \sigma_1 \geq \dots \geq \sigma_r$ be non-zero diagonal elements of $\Sigma$, then the rank of $A$ is $r$. The optimization problem
\begin{equation}
\| A - B \| \to \min \mbox{subject to $\rk B = k $}
\end{equation}
is a matrix analog of \eqref{tucker_min}. Unlike tensor case, this problem can be solved exactly.
Let $\Sigma_k$ be  the matrix obtained from $\Sigma$ by setting $\sigma_{k+1}, \dots, \sigma_r$
to $0$, then the optimal matrix $B$ is $U \Sigma_k V^T$. 

The higher-order singular value decomposition for Tucker2 is formulated as follows.

Compute SVD of unfoldings $\A_{(2)}$ and $\A_{(3)}$:

\begin{eqnarray}
 \A_{(2)} = U_2 \Sigma_2 V_2^T  \\
 \A_{(3)} = U_3 \Sigma_3 V_3^T
\end{eqnarray}
Truncate matrices of left singular vectors $U_2$ and $U_3$ and take the result
as projection matrices $F_2$, $F_3$.

\begin{eqnarray}
F_2 = U_2(:, 1:r_2) \\
F_3= U_3(:, 1:r_3)
\end{eqnarray}

This method is a heuristics, there is no mathematical proof that it gives
the approximation which is in some sense 'good'. However, in practice it produces
results that are reasonable and is used as initialization for iterative methods.
